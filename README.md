The Android project is currently only experimental. It can only encrypt.

To use it, you will need to build the apk and install it on your phone. 

Then go to your phones external storage directory, create a folder called MEND4 and copy your Settings.xml file into it.

All encrypted logs will also be saved in this folder.

Please also note that this project relies on the core mend jar.
